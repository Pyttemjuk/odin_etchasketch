# The Odin Project - Etch-a-Sketch

This is a project that was meant to help me learn DOM manipulation using JavaScript. It was quite easy to set up the JavaScript code since it is a rather simple project, but i found myself refactoring the code a number of times just to get it right using the DRY principle.

As usual the part that takes the longest time is the styling. This is something that I've not practised as much and has less schooling in. I got some practice using flexbox and grid. It was the first time using variables which made the code a bit more manageable.
